Caesar Cipher:
Implement a simple Caesar cipher function that shifts characters in a string by a specified number of positions.

```markdown
A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption method where each letter in a message is replaced by a letter a certain number of positions down the alphabet. This "shift" is the key, so if the shift is 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on, with the alphabet wrapping around from 'Z' to 'A'. It is a type of substitution cipher, named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it for his private correspondence
